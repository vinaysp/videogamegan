# videogamegan
The purpose of this project is to try and apply the GAN model taken from: https://github.com/pavitrakumar78/Anime-Face-GAN-Keras to actual video game levels. 
Folder one contains first run using original GAN model code from above link 
Second Folder contains an adpated code for video game levels, including the images of the video game levels (NOTE: This does not fully execute and is in the process of being edited so that GAN model for the videogame level images do work).
