The purpose of this project is to try and apply the Anime-Face GAN model taken from and created: https://github.com/pavitrakumar78/Anime-Face-GAN-Keras to actual video game levels. 


Anime-Face-GAN-Kerasv1: contains code from the above link to run a GAN model that generates anime faces. 


AdaptedGANmario : contains an adpated GAN code for video game levels, including the images of the super mario levels (NOTE: This does not fully execute and is in the process of being edited so that GAN model for the supermario level images works).
