The purpose of this project is to try and apply the Anime-Face GAN model taken from and created: https://github.com/pavitrakumar78/Anime-Face-GAN-Keras to actual video game levels. 
Anime-Face-GAN-Kerasv1: contains first run using original GAN model code from above link 
Second Folder contains an adpated code for video game levels, including the images of the video game levels (NOTE: This does not fully execute and is in the process of being edited so that GAN model for the videogame level images do work).
